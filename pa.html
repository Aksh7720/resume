      Large-scale deployment of photovoltaic (PV) panels across the world has led to a need for stringent tests and quality checks so that the PV panels can last the expected promise and performance for thirty years. Besides the economic implications, non-performing panels inundating our landscape and rooftops can become a huge potential environmental issue.High-resolution Electroluminescence (EL) images of single-crystalline silicon (sc-Si) solar PV modules are used in our study for the detection of defects and their quality inspection. An automatic cell segmentation methodology is developed to extract cells from an EL image. Contour tracing is used to accurately localize the panel region and a probabilistic Hough transform to identify gridlines and busbars on the extracted panel region for cell segmentation.
